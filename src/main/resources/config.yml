# Plugin version 1.5.0

sendmsgyourself: false
# This item is needed to be able to send a message to yourself
# Accepts only values 'true' and 'false'

msgsound: 'false'
# By default, the sound is turned off 'false', but you can change it
# It is necessary to indicate the name of the sound in uppercase and with underscores
# Example - msgsound: 'ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP'
# All sounds you can find here - https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Sound.html
# Unfortunately not all of these sounds can be reproduced correctly
# Therefore, if the sound doesn't work and gives an error, then you should change the sound

volumesound: 50
# By default, the volume of notification sounds is set to '50', but it can be changed
# The volume value must be specified in the range from '0' to '100'
